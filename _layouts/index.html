      <h3><a href="/post.html">Where did the chocolate chip cookie come from?</a></h3>
      <p class="summary">Information<span class="date">January 02, 2016</span></p>
      <p>The chocolate chip cookie was invented by Ruth Graves Wakefield. She owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts, a very popular restaurant that featured home cooking in the 1930s. Her cookbook, Toll House Tried and True Recipes, was first published in 1936 by M. Barrows &amp; Company, New York. The 1938 edition of the cookbook was the first to include the recipe "Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie" which rapidly became a favorite cookie in American homes.</p>

      <h3><a href="/post.html">What is sour dough?</a></h3>
      <p class="summary">Information<span class="date">January 01, 2016</span></p>
      <p>Sourdough bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally-occurring lactobacilli and yeast. Sourdough bread has a mildly sour taste not present in most breads made with baker's yeast and better inherent keeping qualities than other breads, due to the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli.</p>
